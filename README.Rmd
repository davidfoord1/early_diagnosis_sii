## Early Diagnosis SII and change in SII

Calculate the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) for the early diagnosis of cancer
by Integrated Care Board (ICB) for 2022 and 2023. First it calculates early
diagnosis proportion as incidence at stages 1 and 2 out of all staged incidence.

For each ICB and time period, the early diagnosis proportion is fit to a linear
regression, weighted using inverse variance weighting. SII is the gradient of
the model.

  filter(YEAR == "2023")
